## Image Preprocessing Before Training

### loading the images from folders
I would prefer using OpenCV or PIL to load images from a folder. This is because I have more freedom later to split the dataset and customise the labels. Basicly, I want to build a class similar to the torch function that loads CIFAR-10, controlled by a argument to output training/valid/test sets.
